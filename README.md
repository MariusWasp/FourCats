# FourCats
A libGDX game prototype about four happy cats hunting mice in the garden.
It taught me the very basics of libGDX, and may serve as helpful example to other libGDX beginners.
This prototype illustrates many fundamental concepts of libGDX. However, it is not meant as an example for clean, robust and well engineered code.
